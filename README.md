Welcome to our Study Catalog. This app is designed to be the place to store different resources where we can learn more about software engineering.

üíª When you visit our website you will find a summary of the latest 10 resources that have been added by the cohort.

‚å®Ô∏è Search resources using our searchbar and the tags available to the right of your screen. Don't forget to click the search button!

üë• Log in by selecting your pre-defined user. You will also have the chance to log out.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Interact with our App by adding resources, liking, disliking and even add to a future study list that you can check later!

## Installation

```
yarn
```

## Running dev server

```
yarn start
```

This will start a local server listening for http requests on port 3000.

It will also ask your browser to open a tab to `http://localhost:3000/`

Any type-check and linting errors will appear in the browser and in the terminal output as you browse.
