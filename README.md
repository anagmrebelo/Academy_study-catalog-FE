## Installation

```
yarn
```

## Running dev server

```
yarn start
```

This will start a local server listening for http requests on port 3000.

It will also ask your browser to open a tab to `http://localhost:3000/`

Any type-check and linting errors will appear in the browser and in the terminal output as you browse.
